## Hackathon at Troy University
* in Troy, Alabama.  Jan 2020.
* http://troyhack.com/
* https://troy-hack.devpost.com/

## Goal:
* build an Iron Man type UI in Unity
* UI Aimed at ording food, like on doordash, UberEats, etc
* Ideally, we would have a 2D UI that looks like it's projected on the table in front of you.  Then you can swipe between restaurant menus.  When items are chosen, they would float and become 3D.

## Outcome:
* Our team spent too much time trying to do Virtual Buttons.  The idea of Vitrual Buttons,  sounded good, but they less impressive than they sound.
* Standard hackathon mistake.  Let one issue bog us down and kept us from progressing on the rest of the project. if we focused on building more UI assets and just moved them around with swipes and touches on the phone surface, we could have had a much impressive demo.
* -- Patrick's humble opinion
